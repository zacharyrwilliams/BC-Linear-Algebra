# Linear Algebra
This repository contains my notes out of the book [*Linear Algebra: An Introduction*](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Introduction-Richard-Bronson/dp/0120887843) by Bronson and Costa.

The purpose is to refamiliarize myself with both basic math techniques as well as using LaTeX again.
